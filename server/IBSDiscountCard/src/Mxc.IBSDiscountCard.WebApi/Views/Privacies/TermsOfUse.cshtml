<p>MAXIWOO TERMS OF USE</p>
<p>Last Updated: September 10, 2019</p>
<p>MaxiWoo provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to purchase goods and services at discounted prices and receive non-monetary benefits from various vendors.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "MaxiWoo service", "our service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by MaxiWoo for discovering and using MaxiWoo content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, the website, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service.</p>
<h1>Membership</h1>
<p>1.1. Your MaxiWoo membership will continue until terminated. To use the MaxiWoo service you must have Internet access and a MaxiWoo ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).</p>
<p>1.2. We may offer several membership plans, including special promotional plans or memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your MaxiWoo membership by visiting your profile in our app.</p>
<p>1.3 The membership plans come with different functions and features that we may change without prior notice. This includes including adding new features, replacing old features with better ones or removing a feature to comply with the law.</p>
<p>1.4 Based on your membership type you are entitled to certain type of discount or benefit at certain locations or services if you have a valid and complete profile. However, keep in mind that in case the business suspects fraud it may not grant the discount or benefit. If you do not agree with their decision, contact us immediately to help resolve the issue.</p>
<h1>Free Trials</h1>
<p>2.1. Your MaxiWoo membership may start with a free trial. The duration of the free trial period of your membership will be specified during sign-up and is intended to allow new members and certain former members to try the service.</p>
<p>2.2. Free trial eligibility is determined by MaxiWoo at its sole discretion and we may limit eligibility or duration to prevent free trial abuse. We reserve the right to revoke the free trial and put your account on hold if we determine that you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent MaxiWoo membership are not eligible. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent MaxiWoo membership to determine eligibility. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.</p>
<p>2.3. We will charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your membership prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the membership price and end date of your free trial period, visit your profile in our app.</p>
<h1>Billing and Cancellation</h1>
<p>3.1. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the MaxiWoo service will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific billing date indicated on your "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you sign-up for the service. In some cases, your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. To view the next payment date, visit your profile in our app.</p>
<p>3.2. Payment Methods. To use the MaxiWoo service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</p>
<p>3.3. Updating your Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by contacting us at payment@maxiwoo.com. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).</p>
<p>3.4. Cancellation. You can cancel your MaxiWoo membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the MaxiWoo service through the end of your billing period, unless in free trial. During free trial periods the cancellation takes effect immediately. Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial - month membership periods or unused MaxiWoo content. To cancel, go to your profile in our app and follow the instructions for cancellation or email us at payment@maxiwoo.com. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, go to your profile in our app. If you signed up for MaxiWoo using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your MaxiWoo membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the MaxiWoo service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your MaxiWoo membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.</p>
<p>3.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply to subsequent billing cycles following notice of the change(s) to you.</p>

<h1>Passwords and Account Access</h1>
<p>5.1. The member who created the MaxiWoo account and whose Payment Method is charged (the "Account Owner") has access and control over the MaxiWoo account and the MaxiWoo ready devices that are used to access our service and is responsible for any activity that occurs through the MaxiWoo account. To maintain control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include information on viewing history for the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the MaxiWoo ready devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account. We can terminate your account or place your account on hold in order to protect you, MaxiWoo or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity.</p>
